open_questions: []

milestones:
  v0.1.0:

    status: complete
  v0.2.0:
    hypothesis: >
      CI pipeline users on non-Node stacks see enough Spectral rule parity and actionable
      violation output (with source locations) that they replace Spectral without modifying
      existing .spectral.yaml files.
    scope: see .ilmu/plan.md ## v0.2.0
    status: complete
  v1.0.0:
    hypothesis: public launch — promote when feature-complete and stable
    scope: TBD
