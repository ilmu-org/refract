# refract — Project Standards

Extends org-level standards in `../_ops/CLAUDE.md`. Read that first.

## Project

Fast OpenAPI linter. Ships as single static binary, no Node.js dependency.
Validates OpenAPI 2.x/3.x/3.1 specs against Spectral-compatible OAS ruleset.
Reads existing `.spectral.yaml` / `.spectral.yml` files for zero-migration compatibility.

## Approved idea

ilmu-org/ideas#2

## State

Read `.ilmu/state.md` before any task.
Read `.ilmu/decisions.md` (ADR index) before any architectural choice, then fetch relevant ADR files in `.ilmu/decisions/`. Completed milestone plans archived in `.ilmu/archive/`.
Read `.ilmu/plan.md` before any build task.

## Key constraints (from research)

- Spectral OAS ruleset compatibility = core migration hook — prioritise
- Target: non-Rust CI pipelines (Go, Python, Java) — binary UX matters
- Single static binary: no runtime deps, no install friction
- v0.1.0 scope cut by rust-critic — do not expand
## Git: what is and is not tracked

Gitignored (do not attempt to commit):
- `prompts/` — build and scoping prompts, local only
- `dev/` — session archives
- `handoff.md` — agent handoff state
- `target/` — build artifacts
- `.local/` — local overrides

Tracked (commit normally):
- `src/` — all Rust source
- `tests/` — fixtures and integration tests
- `assets/` — bundled schemas
- `.ilmu/` — state, plan, decisions, ADR files, archives
- `.github/` — workflows and hooks
- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

## Commit messages

Plain conventional commits only: `type: what changed`.
No phase labels (`phase 1`, `phase N`), no step labels, no issue/PR references.
No em-dashes.

## Scoping prompt pre-flight

Before any scoping work, the agent must:
1. Archive the current milestone's plan section to `.ilmu/archive/plan-vX.X.X.md`.
2. Remove that section from `.ilmu/plan.md`, leaving only the archive pointer header.
3. Compress the archive file with caveman compress. Delete the `.original.md` backup.
4. Create and check out the `plan/vX.X.X` branch.

## Build branching

Integration branch: `build/vX.X.X` off `main`.
Phase branches: `phase{N}/vX.X.X`.
- Phase 1 branches from `build/vX.X.X`
- Phase N (N > 1) branches from `phase{N-1}/vX.X.X`

Each phase opens PR targeting `build/vX.X.X`. Do not wait for human PR approval between phases.

After opening each phase PR, wait for CI before proceeding:
```
gh pr checks <PR-number> --watch --fail-fast
```
On failure: fix, push, re-run checks. Do not branch or merge until green.
On success: squash-merge into `build/vX.X.X`, then branch the next phase.

Merge PRs into `build/vX.X.X` in phase order. Document the upstream branch dependency in each PR description.

Final PR: `build/vX.X.X -> main`. Open after all phase PRs merged and integration check passes. Leave for human review, do not merge.

## Git hooks

Hooks live in `.github/hooks/`. After cloning, activate with:
```
git config core.hooksPath .github/hooks
```

Both hooks run the full CI check suite: fmt, clippy, tests, audit, deny, doc.
When CI gains a new check, add it to both `.github/hooks/pre-commit` and `.github/hooks/pre-push`.

## Release description style

Every GitHub release must follow this structure (see v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 as canonical examples):

```
## What's in this release

One sentence summary. Then:

**New rules (N):**
- `rule-id` — description

**Other notable changes** (if any): short bullets.

## Install

Platform table + tar/zip extract commands using the current binary name.

## Quick start

Annotated usage examples covering: basic lint, directory lint, output formats, quiet mode.
```

The release workflow generates an empty description. The release agent must edit it with `gh release edit vX.X.X --notes "..."` before reporting done.

## Writing .ilmu files and prompts

Any agent writing or updating files in `.ilmu/` (state, plan, decisions, ADRs) or creating a prompt file must run the output through the caveman compress skill before writing it to disk:

```
cd ~/.claude/plugins/cache/caveman/caveman/63e797cd753b/caveman-compress
python3 -m scripts <absolute_path_to_file>
```

Delete the `.original.md` backup after verifying compressed file looks correct.
